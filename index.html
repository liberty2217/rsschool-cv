                <li>The goal of studying the field of web development is important for me, because I always wanted to create my own applications or websites that would benefit people and could meet their needs.<br><br>To some extent, my desire to develop in the field of development was determined by the fact that a couple of years ago I went to work for six months in America and used their applications and sites in all areas: banking, social networks, ordering food, etc. After I returned to Russia, I realized that most Russian sites do not meet even close to the functionality that is already standard in various areas abroad. For example, they relate to increased accessibility of the site for people with disabilities, the indication of copyright to the site content, the ability of the user to point out an error on the site, the presence of each site's own application in the phone. After returning, I noticed that all these small details are significant, as they greatly simplify the site's work and make it effective.<br><br>All of these inspired me to become a developer in order to improve the user experience.</li>
